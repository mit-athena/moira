Importing a new Moira snapshot:

0) Run "svn up" to ensure your copy of the Athena source is up to date.

1) In a scratch directory, checkout trunk/moira from the moira repository:

   svn co svn+ssh://svn.mit.edu/moira/trunk/moira moira

2) Make a note of the latest moira revision number (from svn info)

3) cd to a checkout of trunk/third/moira in the athena repo

4) Copy the latest moira checkout into your working copy of the athena
   source.  You'll need to use something that won't copy over the SVN
   metadata.  My preference is for rsync.

   ~/src/athena/third/moira$ rsync -avzC /path/to/moira/checkout/ .

   Consider adding "-n" to rsync's arguments to try it with a dry-run
   first.

5) Sanity check the copy to ensure you didn't omit the trailing slash
   and thus copy the moira subdirectory itself, instead of its contents.

6) Run "svn status" to sanity-check what changed.  Add any new files
   as necessary, either manually, or with something like the following:

   svn status | awk '/^?/ { print $2; }' | xargs svn add

   Also, you'll need to delete any files that no longer exist.  One
   way to do this (probably not the best way) is to go back to your
   moira working copy, and to a reverse merge of the previous imported
   revision.  For example, if the last snapshot was from moira r3987,
   and the current one is r4042:

   ~/scratch/moira$ svn merge -r4042:3987 .

   Then run "svn status" and looked for _added_ files (it's a reverse
   merge), and those are the files to delete.  Or, comb the moirac
   discuss meeting and look for "Removed:" in the commit messages.  Or
   do something else.

7) Run "svn diff" and skim the changes to make sure they look reasonable.

8) Edit debian/changelog, and bump the version number, including the
   datestamp and the moira revision number (see step 2).

9) Commit the change.

10) Update these directions if anything has changed.
