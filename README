README file for building Moira (R)

This is the root directory of MIT Athena's Moira service management
system source code.

Here are the steps for building the Moira source.

1.  If you want to build in the directory with the sources, run
       ./configure
    in that directory. If you want to build in another directory, run
       /path/to/moira/sources/configure
    from that directory. Note that for this to work you will need to
    be using a "make" program that supports VPATH.

    Some options you might want to use:
	 --with-com_err=PREFIX (defaults to util/et)
	 --with-krb5=PREFIX (required)
	 --with-krb4=PREFIX
	 --with-hesiod=PREFIX
	 --with-zephyr=PREFIX
	 --with-oracle=PREFIX (defaults to $ORACLE_HOME, if present)
	 --with-afs=PREFIX (defaults to /usr/afsws, if present)
	 --with-readline=PREFIX

    (When building Moira on Athena, you should use the Athena source
    tree config.site file, either by doing
	 setenv CONFIG_SITE /mit/source/packs/build/config.site
    before running configure, or by using the Athena build system
    script /mit/source/packs/build/do.sh.)

2.  cd to include.  Read through moira_site.h adjusting the paths to
    what you want on your system.  Also change the #define of
    MOIRA_SERVER to be the name of the server you are planning on
    using. (Note that this is only used if hesiod lookup fails.)

3.  After configuring, run "make" to build everything. The server-side
    programs will be built if Oracle was found by configure.

4.  Run "make install".  You may want to check that programs
    are installed where you want.  Then add the appropriate
    directories to your PATH environment variable.
