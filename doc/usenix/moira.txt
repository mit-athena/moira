Maintaining, managing, and supporting an unbounded
number of distributed network services on multiple server instances
requires new solutions.
The Athena Service Management System provides centralized control of data
administration, a protocol for interface to the database, tools for
accessing and modifying the database, and an automated mechanism for
data distribution.

Introduction
.PP
The purpose of the Athena Service Management System (SMS) is to
provide a single point of contact for authoritative information about
resources and services in a distributed computing environment.
SMS is a centralized data administrator providing
network-based update and maintenance of system servers.\(dg
.FS
\(dg Care must be taken to distinguish among different senses of the
word ``server'':
the SMS server, which manages a database;
the servers which provide system services and whose
maintenance are SMS's reason for existence; and the update servers
which allow SMS to affect these system services.
.FE
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
Conceptually, SMS provides mechanisms for managing servers and
resources.  This aspect comprises the fundamental design of SMS.
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
Economically, SMS provides a replacement for labor-intensive
hand-management of server configuration files.
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
Technically, SMS consists of a database, a server and its protocol
interface, a data distribution manager, and tools for accessing and
modifying SMS data.
.LP
SMS provides coherent data access and data update.
Access to data is provided through a
standard application interface.
Programs designed to reconfigure network
servers, edit mailing lists, manage group membership, etc., all use this
application interface.
Applications used as administrative
tools are invoked by users;
applications that update servers are
(automatically) invoked at regular intervals.
Management reports and operational feedback are also provided.
.NH 2
Requirements
.PP
The requirements for the initial Athena SMS include:
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
Management of 15,000 accounts, including individual users, course,
and project accounts, and special accounts used by system services.
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
Management of 1,000 workstations, timesharing machines, and network
servers, including specification of default resource assignments.
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
Allocation of controlled network services,
such as creating and setting quotas for new users'
home directories on network fileservers,
consistent with load-balancing constraints.
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
Maintenance of other control information,
including user groups, mailing lists, access control lists, etc.
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
Maintenance of resource directories, such as the
location of printers, specialized file systems (including
privately supported file systems), and other network services.
.LP
This must be accomplished with the utmost robustness.
.PP
The system must be easily expandable,
both to support additional instances of a particular service
and to offer additional services in the future.
At this time, SMS is used to update three services (with RVD to be
added shortly):
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
.I Hesiod:
The Athena Name Service,
.I Hesiod,
provides service-to-server
and label translation.
It can be thought of as a high-performance, read-only
front-end to the SMS database.
See the companion paper in this volume.

.IP \0\0\(bu 4
NFS:
At Athena, most shared-access read-write file systems
are provided by a locally modified form of the Network File System.
.[
Sandberg NFSUsenix 1985
.]
SMS manages the NFS server hosts,
providing quota-based resource allocation,
and load balancing.
Also refer to the companion paper in this volume.

Steiner KUsenix 1988

.IP \0\0\(bu 4
Mail Service:
Athena's mail service is through a central
routing hub to multiple post office servers
(mail repositories) based on the
Post Office Protocol
.[
Rose POP 1985
.]
(POP) of the Rand Mail Handler
.[
Rand MH 1985
.]
(MH) package.
SMS allocates individual post office boxes to post office servers, and
builds the
.I /usr/lib/aliases
control file used on the central mail hub.
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
RVD:
At Athena, most shared-access read-only file systems
are provided by
a Remote Virtual Disk system.
SMS manages the RVD server hosts,
providing access control lists and
server configuration files.
.PP
Each of these server hosts are controlled by some number of
server-specific data files;
over 50 separate files are required
to support the services described above.
SMS currently supports three 
.I Hesiod
servers, 17 RVD file servers,
32 NFS file servers,
one mail hub and three post offices.
Each RVD server requires one
file, and each server's file is different.
A 
.I Hesiod
server requires 9 separate files containing 64000 resolvable queries,
but each 
.I Hesiod
server receives the same 9 files.
Each NFS server requires two files, one file identical across most NFS
servers, one file different.
The mail hub requires one file, 
.I /usr/lib/aliases.
.NH 2
Design Points
.PP
There are five factors to be taken into account when making design
decisions.
In order of importance, to this project
they are:
.RS 3
.IP 1. 3
Reliability
.IP 2.
Consistency
.IP 3.
Flexibility
.IP 4.
Time Efficiency
.IP 5.
Space Efficiency
.RE
.PP
SMS must be reliable.
In particular, it must be designed to allow
straightforward recreation of SMS on replacement hardware from backups,
should the need arise.
The backup regime for SMS consists of frequent database backups
in ASCII format, to redundant sites.
All components of the SMS system are designed such that a duplicate
configuration can be kept running as a test platform without
interfering with normal, ``real,'' operations.
Service updates are verified by testing the server before calling an
update successful.
Failed operations ring alarms that are heard,
disabling parts of the system if required, but without
interactions with logically unconnected parts of the service
management system. 
Services which are duplicated for availability are updated
such that the service is always available;  i.e., it is
not permitted for server updates to drift into unwarranted
synchrony, bringing down all instances at the same time.
The entire life-cycle is considered part of the package, so
tight change and source-code control
(reviewing each change to source,
running only what can be built from source)
is part of the design.
.PP
In addition to having authoritative control of the data,
SMS must see that the data is kept consistent.
To guarantee internal consistency,
SMS clients do not touch the database directly;
they do not even see the database system used by SMS.
Each application uses the application library to access the database.
This library is a collection of functions allowing access to the database by
communicating with the SMS server using the SMS protocol.
Many of the database consistency constraints are handled by the library.
A number of consistency verification applications also exist.
To make this consistency reliable,
the protocol is designed to be tamper-proof,
withstanding both denial-of-service attacks and malicious attempts to
corrupt the data.
Security is provided with the help of authentication by the
.I Kerberos
private-key authentication system.
See the companion paper in this volume.
.[
Steiner KUsenix 1988
.]
.PP
Beyond these goals, SMS must be flexible in both its database
underpinnings and the services it supports.
As discussed later in the design section, the
particular Database Management System used is insulated from SMS
through a Global DataBase
(GDB) library,
.[
Mendelsohn GDB 1987
.]
making SMS plug-compatible with other database
foundations.
It is independent of the individual services\(emwhile each
service updated by SMS has its own particular data format and
structure, the SMS database stores data in one coherent format.
A separate program,
the Data Control Manager (DCM),
converts SMS database (internal) structure to
server-appropriate structure (such as a configuration file).
When a new service is supported, the database can be changed and only
minimal updates are necessary in the SMS server, and 
a new module is
added to the DCM specifying the additional specific
output data format to be manufactured.
.PP
Also,
in the interests of flexibility,
no administrative
policy decisions are coded into the design.
These are determined only by the data in the database.
.PP
Simplicity of the design is more important than
the speed of operation;
other systems, such as the 
.I Hesiod
name service,
provide a high bandwidth read-only interface to the database.
To this end, the server only supports simple queries.
Processing efficiency for complex queries is maximized by local
applications running on the workstation, not on the central server.
Any set of changes that must be atomic to maintain database
consistency are performed on the server;  sets of non-atomic changes 
and complex lookup operations are supported
in the server only through combining simpler queries.
.NH
System Design
.PP
There are three sides to the SMS system:
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
The input side,
which contains all of the user-interface programs,
allowing the user to enter, examine, or modify data in the database.
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
The database side,
which consists of the actual database,
the SMS server which manipulates the database,
and utility programs to backup, restore,
and verify the internal consistency of the database.
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
The output side,
which extracts information from the database, formats
it into server-specific configuration files, and updates the various
servers by propagating these files.

arrow; circle "Output" "\s8DCM & Update\s0"
.PE

.PP
Various amounts of glue are required to connect these three sides.
At the lowest level,
there is the network protocol that
client programs use to gain access to the database.
This,
however,
depends on the actual model of how database queries are done,
which is influenced
by the organization of the database (but not its exact format,
which is hidden through the protocol).
.NH 2
The SMS Protocol
.PP
The SMS protocol is the fundamental
interface to SMS for client applications.
It allows all clients of SMS to speak a common,
network-transparent language.
.PP
The SMS protocol is a remote procedure call protocol based on the GDB
library,
which in turn uses a TCP stream.
Each client program makes a connection to a
well known port to contact the SMS server,
sending requests and receiving replies
over that stream.
Each request consists of a major request number,
and several counted strings of bytes.
Each reply consists of a single status code followed by zero or more
counted strings of bytes. 
Requests and replies also contain a protocol version number,
to allow clean handling of version skew.
.PP
The following major requests are defined for SMS.
It should be noted that each query
defines its own signature of arguments and results.
For some of these actions the server checks authorization based on the
authenticated identity of the user making the request.
.IP \fBnoop\fP 10
Do nothing.
This is useful for testing and profiling of the server.
.IP \fBauthenticate\fP 10
There is one argument, a 
.I Kerberos
.[
Miller KTech 1987
.]
authenticator.
All requests received after this request are performed on behalf
of the principal identified by the authenticator.
.IP \fBquery\fP 10
The first argument is the name of a pre-defined query (a ``query
handle''), and the rest are arguments to that query.
Queries may retrieve information or modify what is in the database.
If the server query is allowed, any retrieved data
are passed back as several return values.  All but the last returned
value will have a status code 
indicating more data, with the final one
returning the real status code of the query.
.IP \fBaccess\fP 10
There are a variable number of arguments.
The first is the
name of a pre-defined query usable for the ``query'' request,
and the rest are query arguments.
The server returns a reply with a zero
status code if the query would have been allowed,
or a reply with a
non-zero status code explaining why the query was rejected.
.PP
Normal use of the protocol consists of establishing a connection,
providing authentication, then performing a series of queries.
As long as the
application only wants to retrieve data or perform simple updates,
only an authenticate followed by queries are necessary.
The access operation is useful for verifying
that an operation with side effects will succeed before attempting it.
.NH 2
Queries
.PP
All access to the database by clients is provided by the
application library via the SMS protocol.
This interface provides a limited set of predefined, named queries,
allowing tightly controlled access to database information.
Queries fall into four
classes: retrieve, update, delete, and append.
An attempt has been
made to define a set of queries that provide sufficient flexibility to
meet all of the needs of the Data Control Manager as well as the
individual application programs, since the DCM uses the same interface
as the clients to read the database.
Since the database can be modified and extended, the application
library has been designed to allow the easy addition of queries.
.PP
The generalized layer of functions makes SMS independent of the
underlying database.
If a different database management system is required,
the only change needed
will be a new SMS server.
It is made by linking the pre-defined queries to a set of data
manipulation procedures provided by a version of GDB suited to
the alternate DBMS.
.PP
At this time there are over 100 supported queries.  See the complete
technical description of SMS for a listing.

in addition to any errors given above:
.B success
and
.B permission_denied.
.NH 2
The Database Management System
.PP
The database is the core of SMS.
It provides the storage mechanism
for the complete system.
SMS expects its database to consist of
several tables of records with strings, integers, and dates.
Tables
are keyed on one or more fields in each record allowing efficient
retrieval by key or wild cards.
.PP
The database currently in use at Athena is Ingres 
.[
RTIngres 1986
.]
from Relational Technology, Inc.
Ingres provides a complete query system,
a C library of routines,
and a command interface language.
Its advantages are that it is available and that it mostly works.
By design,
SMS does not depend on any special feature of Ingres
so as to retain the option to
utilize other relational database systems.
.PP
The database is an independent entity from the SMS system.
The Ingres query bindings and database-specific routines are layered
at the lower levels of the SMS server.
All applications are independent of database-specific routines.
An application passes
query handles to the SMS server which then resolves the request into
an appropriate database query.
.PP
The database contains several types of objects.  Each object in the
database has an access control list (ACL) associated with it
indicating who is allowed to modify that object.
Each object also has records who last modified it and when that
modification was performed.  
The ACL's are just references to lists in the database.
The database contains the following:
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
User information: full name, login name, user ID, registrar's ID,
login shell, home directory, class year, status, modification time,
nickname, home address, home phone, office address, office phone,
school affiliation, an ACL
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
Machine information: name, type, model, status, serial number, system
type, an ACL
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
Cluster (mapping of machines to default printer and RVD server)
information: name, description, location, default servers, 
machine assignments, an ACL
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
General service information: service name to network port mapping
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
File system configuration: name, type, server host, name on server
host, mount point on client host, access mode, an ACL
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
NFS information: host name, physical disk partition, quota by user
on each partition, an ACL
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
RVD information: host name, physical disk partition, virtual
disks assigned to each partition, pack ID, access passwords, size, an
ACL
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
Printer information: name to 
.I /etc/printcap
entry mapping
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
Post office location: for each user post office server and box on that
server
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
Lists: name, description, modification date, members (which can be
users, other lists, or literal strings), attributes (mailing list,
UNIX group and gid), an ACL
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
Aliases: includes allowed keywords for certain fields in the database,
alternate names for file systems, alternate names for services
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
DCM information: services to be updated, hosts supporting each
service, target files on each host, last update time,
enable/override/success flags for updates
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
Internal control information: next user ID, group ID, machine ID, and
cluster ID to assign (these are just hints); an ACL for each query; usage
statistics
.NH 2
SMS-to-Server Update Protocol
.PP
SMS provides a reliable mechanism for updating the servers it manages.
The goals of the server update protocol are:
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
Rational, automatic update for normal cases and expected kinds of failures.
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
Ability to survive clean (target) server crashes.
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
Ability to survive clean SMS crashes.
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
Easily understood state so that straightforward recovery by hand is
possible.
.PP
All actions are initiated by the SMS system.
Updates of managed servers are performed such that a partially completed
update is harmless.
Updates not completed are simply rescheduled for retry until
they succeed, or until an update can not be initiated.
In the latter case, a human operator will be notified.
.PP
The update protocol is based on the GDB library just as is the SMS protocol
itself.  In the update protocol, there are four commands:
.IP \fBauthenticate\fP 11
A 
.I Kerberos
authenticator is sent.  The update server on
the target
server uses this authenticator to verify that the entity
contacting it is authorized
to initiate updates.
.IP \fBtransfer\fP
This command is used for sending information, usually entire
files.  The protocol is capable of efficiently sending a half-megabyte
binary file.
.IP \fBinstructions\fP
This sends over a command script, which when executed on the target
server will install the new configuration files just sent.
.IP \fBexecute\fP
This instructs the update server to execute the instructions
just sent.
.PP
In typical usage, all four commands are used in the order presented above.
Multiple transfers may be necessary for some server types.  Note that
when data files are transfered, they do not directly overwrite the
existing data files.  Instead, they are put in a temporary position.
When the update is executed, the old files are renamed to another
temporary name, and the new files are given the correct names.  This
minimizes the interval during which a server system crash would leave an
inconsistent set of configuration files.  If all portions of the
preparation are completed without error, the execution is then
allowed.  This usually consists of moving files around, then sending a
signal to or restarting a server process.  The update server then
performs a plausibility check on the result by verifying the operation
of the system server, and sends SMS an indicative return code.
.NH 1
System Components
.PP
Six software components make up the SMS system.
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
The database, currently built on the commercial database system
RTI Ingres.
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
The SMS server, a program always running on the machine containing the
database.  It accesses the database for the client programs.
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
The application library, a collection of routines implementing the SMS
protocol.  It is used by client programs to communicate with the
SMS server.
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
The client programs, a collection of programs that make up
the user interface to the system.
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
The data control manager, a program run periodically by
.I cron
and driven by data in the database.
It constructs up-to-date server configuration
files and installs these files on the servers.
.IP \0\0\(bu 4
The update servers, which run on each machine containing a server that
SMS updates.
These are contacted by the data control manager to
install the new configuration files and notify the real servers being
managed by SMS.

.PE

.PP
Because SMS has a variety of interfaces, a distinction must be
maintained between applications called clients that directly read and
write to SMS (i.e., administrative programs) and services which use
information distributed from SMS (i.e. a name server).  In both cases
the interface to the SMS database is through the SMS server, using the SMS
protocol.  The significant difference is that server update is handled
automatically through the Data Control Manager; administrative programs
are executed by users.
.NH 2
Clients
.PP
SMS includes a set of specialized management tools to grant system
administrators overall control of system resources.
For each system service there
is an administrative interface.  To accommodate novice and occasional
users, a menu interface is the default.  For regular users, a
command-line switch is provided that will use a line-oriented
interface.  This provides speed and directness for users
familiar with the system, while being reasonably helpful to novices
and occasional users.  A specialized menu building tool has been
developed in order that new application programs can be developed
quickly.  This user interface does not depend on the X Window System.
.[
Scheifler XACM 1987
.]
It must be possible for
system operators to use dumb terminals to correct resource problems,
i.e. it cannot be a requirement that a high level of functionality
be present before the service management system can operate.
.PP
Fields in the database have associated with them lists of legal
values.  A null list indicates that any value is possible.  This is
useful for fields such as \fIuser_name, address\fP, and so forth.  The
application programs, before attempting to modify anything in the
database, request this information, and compare it with the proposed
new value.  If an invalid value is discovered, it is reported to the
user, who is given the opportunity to change the value, or ``insist''
that it is a new, legal value.  (The ability to update data in the
database does not necessarily indicate the ability to add new legal
values to the database.)
.PP
Applications should be aware of the ramifications of their actions,
and notify the user if appropriate.  For example, an administrator
deleting a user is informed of storage space that is being reclaimed,
mailing lists that are being modified, and so forth.
Objects that need to be
modified at once (such as the ownership of a mailing list)
present themselves to be dealt with.
.PP
The following list of client programs are currently in use at Project
Athena.  These are rewrites of standard 
UNIX
programs, and are available to
regular users:

.NH 3
New User Registration
.PP
A specialized client is the new user registration program.  A new
student must be able to claim an Athena account without any intervention
from Athena user accounts staff.
Without this the user accounts staff would be faced with manually
creating hundreds of accounts at the beginning of each academic term. 
.PP
Athena obtains a copy of the official list of registered students from
the MIT Registrar shortly before the start of each term.  The 
.I regtape
client adds each student on the Registrar's tape who has not already
been registered for an Athena account to the ``users'' relation of the
database, and assigned a unique user ID; the student is not assigned a
login name or any other resources at this time.  A one-way encrypted
form of the student's ID number is stored along with the name.  No
other database resources are allocated at that time.  This ID number
and the exact spelling of the student's full name as recorded by the
Registrar are all that are needed for a student to claim an account.
Thus the ID number is something of a password until a real account has
been set up.
.PP
When the student decides to register with Athena, he or she walks up
to any workstation and logs in using the username of ``register''.
This produces a form-like interface prompting for the user's first
name, middle initial, last name, and student ID number.  The
.I register
program does not talk to the SMS server directly, but goes through a
registration server first.  The registration server deals with access
control to the SMS server and the
.I Kerberos
administration server.
Register encrypts the ID number, and sends a
.I verify_user
request to the registration server.  The server responds with
.B
already_registered, not_found,
.R
or
.B OK.
After this the
register server will do work on behalf of the user; the user still
cannot contact SMS directly until he or she obtains a login name and
user ID.
.PP
If the user has been validated,
.I register
then prompts the student for a
choice in login names.  It then goes through a two-step process to
verify the login name: first, it simulates a login request for this
user name with
.I Kerberos;
if this fails (indicating that the username
is free and may be registered), it then sends a
.B grab_login
request.  On receiving a
.B grab_login
request, the registration server then proceeds to register the login
name with
.I Kerberos;
if the login name is already in use, it returns a failure code to
.I register.
Otherwise, it allocates a home directory for the user
on the least-loaded fileserver,
sets an initial disk quota for the user,
builds a post office entry for the user
on the least-loaded post office server,
and returns a success code
to
.I register.
SMS keeps track of loading on servers in the database, incrementing
and decrementing its estimate of the load as it allocates and
deallocates resources on each server.
.PP
.I Register
then prompts the user for an initial password.
It sends a
.B set_password
request to the registration server, which decrypts it and forwards it to
.I Kerberos.
At this point, pending propagation of
information to the 
.I Hesiod
name service, the central mail hub, and the user's home fileserver,
the user's account has been established.
These updates may take up to 12 hours to complete.
.NH 2
The SMS Server
.PP
As previously stated,
all remote communication with the SMS database is done through the SMS
server, using the SMS protocol.  The SMS server runs as a single 
UNIX
process on the SMS database machine.  It listens for connections on a
well known service port and processes remote procedure call requests
on each connection it accepts.
.PP
GDB, through the use of BSD
UNIX
non-blocking I/O, allows the
programmer to set up a single-process server that handles multiple
simultaneous TCP connections.  The SMS server will be able to make
progress reading new RPC requests and sending old replies
simultaneously, which is important if a reasonably large amount of
data is to be sent back.  The RPC system from Sun Microsystems was
also considered for use in the 
RPC layer, but was rejected because it cannot handle large return
values, such as might be returned by a complex query.
.PP
A major concern for efficiency in some DBMS's is the time it
takes to begin accessing the database, sometimes requiring starting up
a backend process.  Since this is a heavyweight operation, the
SMS server will do this only once when it starts.
.PP
The server performs access control checks on all queries.  An access control
list (ACL) is associated with each query handle, and with many objects within
the database.  For instance, to add someone to a list, it is
sufficient to either be on the ACL associated with the
.B add_member_to_list
query, or to be on the ACL of the list in
question.  
In addition, lists, users, machines, and
file systems have lists of additional users who are allowed to modify
them.
The concept of an all powerful database administrator is
not necessary with SMS, although could be implemented by having the
same ACL for all queries that affect the database.
.PP
Because one of the requests that the server supports is a request to
check access to a particular query, it is expected that many access
checks will have to be performed twice: once to allow the client to
find out that it should prompt the user for information, and again
when the query is actually executed.  It is expected that some form of
access caching will eventually be worked into the server for
performance reasons.
.NH 3
Input Data Checking
.PP
Without proper checks on input values, a user could easily enter data
of the wrong type or of a nonsensical value for that
type into SMS.  For example, consider the case of updating a user's mail
address.  If, instead of typing ``athena-po-1'' (a valid post office server),
a user accounts administrator
typed in ``athena-po1'' (a nonexistent machine), all the user's mail
would be returned to sender as undeliverable. 
.PP
Input checking is done by both the SMS server and by applications
using SMS.  Each query supported by the server may have a validation
routine supplied which checks that the arguments to the query are
legitimate.  Queries that do not have side effects on the database do
not need a validation routine.
.PP
Some checks are better done in applications programs; for example, the
SMS server is not in a good position to tell if a user's new choice
for a login shell exists.  However, other checks, such as verifying
that a user's home directory is a valid file system name, are conducted
by the server.  An error condition will be returned if the value
specified is incorrect.  The list of predefined queries defines those
fields which require explicit data checking.
.NH 2
Backup
.PP
It is not critical that the SMS database be available 24
hours a day; what is important is that the database remain internally
consistent and that the data never be lost.  With that in
mind, the database backup system for SMS has been set up to maximize
recoverability if the database is damaged.  Backup is done
in a simple ASCII format to avoid dependence on the actual DBMS in use.
.PP
Two programs
.I (smsbackup
and
.I smsrestore)
are generated
automatically (using an
.I awk
script) from the database description
file.
.I smsbackup
copies each relation of the current SMS database
into an ASCII file.
.I Smsbackup
is invoked nightly by a command
file that maintains the last three backups on-line.  These backups
are put on a separate physical disk drive from the drive containing
the actual database and copied over the network to other locations.
.I Smsrestore
does the inverse of
.I smsbackup,
taking a set of ASCII files and recreating the
database.  These backups by themselves provide recovery with the loss of no
more than roughly a day's transactions.  To obtain complete recovery,
it is necessary to examine the log files of the servers.
An automated procedure to do this has not been written since it is
complicated and has not been needed yet.
.NH 2
The Data Control Manager
.PP
The Data Control Manager is a program responsible for
distributing information to servers.  The DCM is invoked by
.I cron
at regular, frequent intervals.
The data that drives the DCM is read from the database, rather
than being coded into the DCM or kept in separate configuration files.
Each time the DCM is run, it scans the database to
determine which servers need updating.  Only those that need
updating because their configuration has changed and their update
interval has been reached will be updated.
.PP
The determination that it is time to check a service is based on
information about that service in the database.  Each service has an
update interval, specifying how often providers of that service should
be updated, and an enable flag.  For each server/host tuple, the
database stores the time of the last update attempt, whether or not it
was successful, and an override flag.  If the previous update attempt
was not successful, the override flag will indicate when to try again.
The administrative user's interface provides a mechanism to set the
override flag manually, so as to update a server sooner than it
otherwise would be updated.  
.PP
Locking is also provided since an update may still be in progress the
next time the DCM is invoked.  Without this locking the new DCM
process would attempt to update the same service that the older process
is still working on.
.PP
If it is necessary to update a server, a separate program (also named in
the database) is invoked to extract the information from the database
and format into the server-specific files.  The DCM then contacts the
update server on the machine with the target server, 
sends the necessary data files and the shell script that is invoked
on the server machine to install the new files.  
The success flag is set or cleared based on whether the update attempt
succeeded.  If the attempt failed, the override flag is set,
requesting that another attempt be made to update this server sooner
than indicated by the default update interval.
.PP
For performance reasons, some parts of the DCM currently touch the
database directly rather than going through the SMS server.  Nothing
is being done that could not be done through the server.  However,
bypassing the server makes extracting large amounts of information
much faster and avoids slowing down the server for these operations.
.NH 1
System Performance
.PP
The system is more reliable than the one previously in
use at Athena.  The old version had an update mechanism more suited to
the scale 
of tens of timesharing hosts rather than thousands of workstations.
System crashes have been rare.
The speed of the system
is fair, being fast enough to use interactively, although some queries
do take a while to complete.  The database currently
occupies about 13 megabytes on the server.
.PP
Most of the system as described here has been in use for over six
months.  A few of the points mentioned here are just now being
implemented and put into service.
Note that this is the only management
tool for 5000 active users, 650 workstations, and 65 servers.
.NH 2
Availability
.PP
The SMS server has nearly always been accessible.  Some queries, such
as listing all publicly accessible mailing lists, will tie up the
server for a short period of time.  Regular users are prohibited from
the longer queries such as listing all users, which will lock up the
server for several minutes.  The server is occasionally down for
safety when an SMS administrator wishes to modify the database directly
through Ingres.
.NH 2
Security
.PP
.I Kerberos
authentication on all network access and physical security
of the machine have been sufficient to prevent breakins.
However, the system has not had enough exposure to believe
it is really resistant to concerted attacks.
.PP
One problem with the current implementation
has to do with security and access control lists.  It is difficult to
administer the numerous ACL's in the system, and it is not always obvious
when different queries are used to predict the effects of changing an
ACL.  Currently this problem is avoided by having two classes of
queries: those that anyone can do, and those that only the database
administrators can perform.  There need to be more intermediate
levels.  For instance, it would be useful to allow some system operators
to change the information describing public workstations, but not the
timesharing machines and service hosts.
.NH 2
Consistency
.PP
The current database suffers from decay.  The database grows indexes
and reference counts that are wrong, post office boxes that do not
belong to any user, and groups with no members.  These are assumed to
be caused by coding errors in the client library and clients.  Any
problem is potentially compounded by the very
.I
raison d'\*^etre
.R
of SMS.
With hundreds of workstations in the field there is no guarantee that SMS
client programs installed on them are all at current revision level.
There are also a few problems suspected in the
database system itself (Ingres), but these are difficult to pinpoint.
However, the various data extraction programs used by the DCM are
robust; they skip over any inconsistent records so these cause few
problems.
.PP
A database consistency checker, in the spirit of
.I fsck,
is run
regularly, but only for informational purposes.  Because of the
dangers involved in modifying the database outside the SMS server, it
is not modified by this checker at this time.
.PP
A shortcoming of the current system is that it is occasionally
necessary to use Ingres directly to make some modification to the
database.  For example, it was recently necessary to modify every
instance of a particular login shell in the user account information.
A special client could have been written to do this, but it would only
be used once, so the operation was done interactively with the Ingres
query interpreter.  A large number of similar operations to be
executed would normally imply a need for a generalized batch
processor.  This is is too complicated for our needs, hence such
operations are either done by hand through the regular clients, or
edited into a script that can be run through the raw Ingres
interpreter.  Availability of this interpreter makes such operations
relatively easy; yet there is the temptation to fix too many things
that way, bypassing the checks built in to the client library and SMS
server.
.PP
Care must be taken to avoid hardcoding into the SMS design current
policy decisions about accounts and resources here at Athena.  Yet by
maintaining this flexibility, it sometimes is too easy to break the
rules.  This is more often an error than an intentional breaking of
the rules.
For instance, there have been users who did not have a post office box
because of administrative mistakes; they were unable to receive mail.
.NH 1
Conclusion
.PP
Systems for managing the otherwise unmanageable need
to be designed well, burned in realistically, and
provided with seamless upgrades.
With the Athena SMS, we have an example
of a system that is working for the scale of 1,000
workstations, but needs significant
refinement to go to the 10,000 workstation level.
The initial vision has proven correct; the remaining
question is whether the design as we now have it will
be capable of the next leap in scale.  We believe it
will and will be back to report to you with our results.
