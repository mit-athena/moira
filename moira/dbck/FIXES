================================
PHASE 1: looking for duplicates

	* don't delete both if one is placeholder *

F* Each principal can appear at most once in the krbmap
   Each mach_id must be unique
	Alloc new ID

	Alloc new ID
   Each string must be unique
	Delete second copy and remember this for phase 2
   Each string_id must be unique
	Delete all copies
F* Each printer name must be unique

PHASE 2: checking references

	Delete pobox
   Each user's SMTP pobox must have a string
	Delete pobox

	Put it on machine 0
P  Every filesys' owning user must exist
	Make it user 0
P  Every filesys' owning group must exist
	Make it list 0
   Every NFS filesys' phys_id must exist
P	Set to correct one if found
	    else create one
   Every fsgroup must exist
	Delete the fsgroup
  *Every fsgroup must be of type FSGROUP
	Change type
P  Every fsgroup member must exist
	Delete member
P  Every USER quota must be for a real user
	Delete quota
P  Every GROUP quota must be for a real list
	Delete quota
   Every quota must be on a real filesys
	Delete quota
P  Every quota's phys_id must match the filesys' phys_id
	Fix phys_id
 **Zephyr checks
 * Every hostaccess must be for a real machine
 * Every hostaccess USER must exist
 * Every hostaccess LIST must exist
   Every printer must have real printer, spool, and quota machines
	Delete the printer
 * Every printer must have a real log machine

	Make it list 0
P  Every user in the krbmap must exist
	Delete map entry
P  Every string in the krbmap must exist
	Delete map entry
 * Every list used in capacls must exist

PHASE 3: finding unused objects

   Every list must have at least one member (if -w flag not specified)
	Print warning
P  Every string must be used at least once
	Delete string

PHASE 4: checking counts

 * Every POP pobox must be on a POP server
P  The count of POP boxes must match value1 of the service/host tuple
	update count
P  The total quota on an NFSphys must match the recorded allocation
	update count
