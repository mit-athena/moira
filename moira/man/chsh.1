.SH DESCRIPTION
This command changes the login shell associated with
.IR username
(your own name by default).
While you can specify any program as a command interpreter, be
cautious about specifying a program that won't let you change your
login shell to something else (i.e., a noninteractive program like
"date").
.PP
When invoked,
.B chsh
displays the current shell, and prompts for the new one unless the
.BI \-s
option has been specified.
.PP
If invoked with the 
.BI \-w 
option, chsh will change the user's Windows shell instead of their
UNIX shell.  The default behavior is to change the user's UNIX shell,
and the 
.BI \-u
option is provided to explicitly select this behavior.

The actual change will take place following the next Hesiod update
from Moira, which generally occurs within three hours.
Users may only change their own information unless they are
Moira database administrators.
