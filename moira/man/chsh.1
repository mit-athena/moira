.SH NAME
chsh \- change user login shell
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B chsh
[
.BI \-u
|
.BI \-w
] [
.BI \-db
.I host:port
]
[ username ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This command changes the login shell associated with
.IR username
(your own name by default).
While you can specify any program as a command interpreter, be
cautious about specifying a program that won't let you change your
login shell to something else (i.e., a noninteractive program like
"date").
.PP
When invoked,
.B chsh
displays the current shell, and prompts for the new one.
.PP
If invoked with the 
.BI \-w 
option, chsh will change the user's Windows shell instead of their
UNIX shell.  The default behavior is to change the user's UNIX shell,
and the 
.BI \-u
option is provided to explicitly select this behavior.

The actual change will take place overnight.
Users may only change their own information unless they are
Moira database administrators.
