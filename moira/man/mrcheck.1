.SH NAME
mrcheck \- verify that Moira updates are successful
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mrcheck [-noauth]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Mrcheck
will query the Moira database to determine which services and hosts have
failed updates.  It will display a summary of each, listing the name,
error code and message, last successful update, and last attempted
update.  If all services are up-to-date, this will be indicated.
.PP
If the
.B -noauth
flag is given, 
.I mrcheck
will not attempt to authenticate to the moira server.  This is useful
if it is run out of a script and Moira has been configured to allow
this to run without authentication.
