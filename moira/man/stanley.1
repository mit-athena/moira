Give more information.  With this flag, stanley will display the
queries it is making to the moira server.
.IP \fB-noauth\ \fRor\ \fB-n\fR
Do not attempt to perform Kerberos authentication with the Moira server.
Most lookup operations should be still possible without tickets.
.IP \fB-database\ \fIhost:port\ \fRor\ \fB-db\ \fIhost:port\fR
Use the specified host and port to contact the Moira database instead of
the default server.  Both may be symbolic names or numbers.  If the
port is left off, the default Moira server port will be assumed.  The
database chosen will be the one specified on the command line, specified
in the MOIRASERVER environment variable, the hesiod "moira" sloc entry,
or the compiled in default, in that order or preference.

.IP \fB-create\ \fRor\ \fB-C\fR
This will create the specified user, with information provided by other

a unique username and uid, and will not require an Account Coupon to register.
.IP \fB-deact\ \fRor\ \fB-D\fR
This will deactivate the specified user, as well as the matching list
and filesystem, assuming they exist.
.IP \fB-rename\ \fInewname\ \fRor\ \fB-R\ \fInewname\fR
This will rename the given user to \fInewname\fR.
.IP \fB-register\ \fRor\ \fB-r\fR
This will register the specified username, creating a filesystem and
assigning a PO Box.  It will not create a Kerberos principal.  A status
0 user will be status 2 after having been registered in this way, and
the user will still need to use the registration applet to set an
initial password.  Status 6 users will be status 1 and have full Athena
accounts after being registered.

.SH DIAGNOSTICS
An exit status of 2 indicates a problem contacting the server. An exit
status of 1 indicates that the arguments could not be parsed or some
query to the moira server returned an error. An exit status of 0
indicates that all operations requested completed successfully.

.SH NOTES
The username doesn't actually have to be the first argument, but if
you put it anywhere else, it's easy to get the other arguments in the
wrong order and do something other than what you intended.
