The executables are in /moira/bin/ on the moira server, with sources in
/mit/moiradev/src/reg_svr/.  Most of the commands are run on the Moira
server.  

Step 1:  Generate a list of all the MIT id numbers for the incoming
class you care about; It's important that you order them by the full
name of the student in question.  Sample SQL:

set head off
spool /var/tmp/mitids
SELECT clearid FROM users WHERE type='2004' AND status=0
ORDER BY last, first, middle;

Replace "2004" with the year of the entering class as necessary.

Step 2: Feed the list of MIT id numbers to genwords, and save the output
to a file.  Sample sh script:

for i in `cat /var/tmp/mitids.lst`; do
    /moira/bin/genwords -v $i >> /var/tmp/genwords.out
done

Step 3:  Append the output of genwords to the default coupon, which is
located in the Moira source tree under reg_svr/coupons/coupon.ps.
Sample command:

cp /mit/moiradev/src/reg_svr/coupons/coupon.ps /var/tmp
cat genwords.out >> coupon.ps

Step 4: Print the coupons:

lpr -Pprintername coupon.ps
