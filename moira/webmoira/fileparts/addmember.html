<p>List owners may add list members of three common types:<br>

<font size="-1">
<ul>

  <li><b><a href="help.jhtml#user">user</a></b> -- member with an
Athena username.  To add a user to an Athena list, enter only member
name to the left of the @ (e.g. add eclapton for eclapton@mit.edu)</li>


  <li><b><a href="help.jhtml#list">list</a></b> -- member which is
another Athena list.  To add accounts@mit.edu as a member, select
member type list, and type accounts as the member name. </li>


  <li><b><a href="help.jhtml#string">string</a></b> -- members with
email addresses outside of mit.edu, such as mitalum@anotherisp.net.
To add this email as a member, select member type string and type the
complete address.</li>

</ul>
</font>
</p>

<p>Select the type of member you wish to add, and enter the member(s)
you wish to add. You may enter more than one member of the <b>same
type</b> by listing each member on its own line.</p>
