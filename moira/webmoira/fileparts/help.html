<p><b><font size="+1"><a name="manage"></a>How to Manage your Athena
Lists</font></b></p>

<p>Athena List Management is one of the tools list owners have to
manage their lists. Other tools include blanche and listmaint on
Athena. To get started, you will need MIT <a
href="http://web.mit.edu/is/help/cert/">Personal Certificates</a> on
your machine. Once you have them, select any function, provide a list
name, and press enter on your keyboard, or 'Go'. Each page of the web
interface has context sensitive help to guide you. <a

Contact for Help</font></b></p>

<p>If you do need further assistance with your lists, <a
href="http://web.mit.edu/accounts/">Athena User Accounts</a> provides
assistance with Athena list concerns, including creating new lists,
modifying lists, and deleting lists. If you have trouble using this
interface to maintain your lists, please contact Accounts at <a

<p><b><font size="+1"><a name="glossary"></a>Glossary of List
Management Terms</font></b></p>

<p><a name="description"></a><b>List Description</b><br> A short
description may be specified for an Athena list. This description is
displayed for lists which are not marked hidden if list information is
generated by another Athena user. <a href="#helptop"><font
size="-1">[top of help]</font></a><br> </p>

<p><a name="maillist"></a><b>Mailing List</b><br> An Athena list is by
default a mailing list. That means that the members of the list will
be mailable through the address <em>listname</em>@mit.edu, which will
distribute the mail the all the members of the list. Such a list may
include email addresses for users outside of MIT. Lists can be both a
mailing list and a group. <a href="#helptop"><font size="-1">[top of
help]</font></a><br> </p>

<p><a name="group"></a><b>Group</b><br> In addition to (or instead of)
being a mailing list, an Athena list can also be a group. A group can
be used as an access control list on the AFS file system, for
example. If you wish to be able to set access permissions on an Athena
directory or locker for the members of your list, you should choose to
make it a group.  When a list can maintain a file space on Athena, it
is also has a group ID number.  </p>

<p>Note that only Athena users on your list will be able to take
advantage of this feature. If you have any other members on your list,
such as email addresses outside of MIT, they will not be able to
access Athena file systems. <a href="#helptop"><font size="-1">[top of
help]</font></a></p>

<p><a name="admin"></a><b>List Administrator(s)</b><br> Every Athena
mailing list must be owned by one or more
administrators. Administrators have the power to change list
characteristics. Administrators can be a user or another Athena
list. <a href="#helptop"><font size="-1">[top of help]</font></a></p>

<p><a name="permissions"></a><b>List Permissions</b><br> These
describe the state of the list and what users who are not the
administrator can do with the list. A list's permissions can be viewed
with the &quot;display list characteristics&quot; option, and edited
by list owners with the &quot;update list characteristics&quot;
option.</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>active</b> -- the list is live and usable</li>
       
  <li><b>inactive</b> -- the list has been turned off, is still in the
system, but mail sent will bounce and/or group permissions will not
work</li>

  <li><b>public</b> -- any user can add themselves to this list</li>

  <li><b>private</b> -- only the administrator can add users to the list</li>

  <li><b>visible</b> -- any user can view basic information about a
list, such as membership and administrators</li>

  <li><b>hidden</b> -- list information is hidden, but can be viewed
by the list administrators </li>

</ul>

<p><a name="lastmod"></a><b>Last Modification</b><br> This tells you
when the list was last changed in some way and by who. <a
href="#helptop"><font size="-1">[top of help]</font></a></p>

<p><a name="user"></a><b>Athena User</b><br> Email addresses of the
form name@mit.edu usually indicate name is an Athena username (also
sometimes called a Kerberos Name or MIT Network ID). To add an Athena
user to an Athena list, you enter only member name to the left of the
@. For example, to add eclapton@mit.edu to an Athena list, provide
'eclapton' as the member name. <a href="#helptop"><font size="-1">[top
of help]</font></a></p>

<p><a name="list"></a><b>List</b><br> An Athena list is by default a
mailing list. That means that the members of the list will be mailable
through the address listname@mit.edu, which will distribute the mail
the all the members of the list. Such a list may include email
addresses for users outside of MIT.</p>

<p>List members can be other Athena lists, of the form
listname@mit.edu. To add an Athena list as a member of another Athena
list, enter only the part of the address before the @ symbol. For
example, to add accounts@mit.edu as a member, provide 'accounts' as
the member name. <a href="#helptop"><font size="-1">[top of
help]</font></a></p>

<p><a name="string"></a><b>String</b><br> Athena lists often have
non-MIT users and lists as members. To add an email address that
contains an @ but is outside of mit.edu, such as
mitalum@anotherisp.net, you add them as member type string. To add a
string, provide the complete address, including information on both
sides of the @. <a href="#helptop"><font size="-1">[top of
help]</font></a></p>

<p><a name="kerbprincipal"></a><b>Kerberos Principal</b><br>
Specifying a list member as a Kerberos principal allows a member to be
on a list without receiving any email sent to the list. This is a
rarely used member type. <a href="#helptop"><font size="-1">[top of
help].</font></a></p>
