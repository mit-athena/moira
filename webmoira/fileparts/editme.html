<p>MIT community members may add themselves to any public Athena list
and remove themselves from any Athena lists.</p>

<p>Below you will see if you are currently a member of a list, and be
prompted to change your membership.</p>

<p>Be aware that Athena lists can contain other Athena mailing lists.
If you are not a member of a list directly, you may still be on the
list through another list that is a member (called a sublist).  If
this is the case, you can use the <b>show list members</b> function to
see what sublists are members of this list.</p>
